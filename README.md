# Projects
These are various projects I did to practice different skills using R and Python

- City Maps in R: This is an R script I used to create those city map poster you can find online. 
  I liked those posters and wanted to gift one to a friend, but they were kind of expensive, so I figured I could do it myself
  The output of the script is a GG plot with any features you select, I exported that as a PDF and 
  used Adobe Illustrator to add finish it with details, they turned out pretty good with perfect vector quality.
