# Projects
These are various projects I did to practice different skills using R and Python

- City Maps in R: This is an R script I used to create those city map poster you can find online. 
  I liked those posters and wanted to gift one to a friend, but they were kind of expensive, so I figured I could do it myself
  The output of the script is a GG plot with any features you select, I exported that as a PDF and 
  used Adobe Illustrator to add finish it with details, they turned out pretty good with perfect vector quality.

- PhD Course - Linear Mixed Models: This is a course I created and taught during my PhD for my colleagues. It was a short course aimed at teaching the basics of using Linear Mixed Models to analyse repeated measures designs (as an alternative for RM ANOVA). The course starts with RM ANOVA, explains the assumptions, and moves on to Mixed Models, Covariance Matrices, and interpreting results.
  I based the course in SPSS, since this was the software used as the university and the one most people we familiar with. At the same time it also provided a nice User Interface and output that didn't require anyone to know coding.


- Twitter User Sentiment Analysis: This is my first attempt at Sentiment Analysis, which I chose to do on my own tweets.
  I used various tutorials and guides to retrieve my tweets and then analyze them using NLTK,
  To properly analyze the tweets I had to manipulate the data using Pandas, RegEx, and some Numpy functions.
  Plotting the results and making wordclouds required MatPlotLib
